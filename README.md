# Email and Slack Integration Plugins

This project provides a straightforward way to connect email and Slack functionalities into your applications.

What this really means is you get two distinct plugins: one for handling emails and another for interacting with Slack.

---

## üîß Plugin Breakdown

- **Email Plugin**: A service that allows you to interact with Gmail using the SMTP and IMAP protocols.
- **Slack Plugin**: A service to interact with your Slack workspace.

Each plugin is built as a separate application, making it easy to use only the one you need.

---

## üìÅ Repository Structure and File Information

- `email_plugin/`: Contains everything needed for the email service.
- `slack_plugin/`: Holds the files for the Slack integration.
- `app.py` and `slack_app.py`: These are the main Python files for each plugin.
- `.env`: Environment files that store secret keys and other configuration details. One for each plugin.
- `.yaml`: These files define the API for each plugin using the OpenAPI specification. They guide how the API works.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages you need to install.

### Testing with Postman and ngrok
Here's the thing about testing a local web service: it's not accessible from the internet. That's where ngrok comes in.
ngrok creates a secure tunnel to your local machine, giving you a public URL that you can use to test your API from anywhere.
